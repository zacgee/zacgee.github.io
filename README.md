# zacgee.github.io

This is my personal website built using **Jekyll** and **Ruby**, hosted on GitHub Pages. The website serves as a portfolio to showcase my projects, skills, and achievements as a computer science student. It is designed to be both a professional and personal space where I can share insights about my work, interests, and experiences.

## Features

- **Project Portfolio**: A collection of my most significant projects, each with a detailed description and links to the source code.
- **Blog**: A section where I write about topics related to technology, coding, and personal growth.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Custom Jekyll Theme**: Iâ€™ve used a custom Jekyll theme to give the website a clean and professional look.

## Technologies Used

- **Jekyll**: A static site generator that simplifies the process of building and deploying websites.
- **Ruby**: Used to power the Jekyll framework.
- **Markdown**: For writing blog posts and content.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the website.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the website directly from the GitHub repository.
